# Monitoring-and-Drift-Detection-Libraries

This component will provide a set of tools that works in collaboration with the Monitoring solution 
and helps the Application to provide feedback to the platform in cases that detects any data drift.

This can be achieved by multiple ways:
- By modifying a part of the Application in order to include and use the offered client that communicates with
the tool
- By modifying a part of the Application and making some Rest calls at the tool itself.
